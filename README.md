Cayley is an open-source database for [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data). It is inspired by the graph database behind Google's [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph) (formerly [Freebase](http://freebase.com)).

### Performance

Rough performance testing shows that, on 2014 consumer hardware and an average disk, 134m quads in LevelDB is no problem and a multi-hop intersection query -- films starring X and Y -- takes ~150ms.
