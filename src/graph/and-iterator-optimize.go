// Perhaps the most tricky file in this entire module. Really a method on the
// AndIterator, but important enough to deserve its own file.
//
// Calling Optimize() on an And iterator, like any iterator, requires that we
// preserve the underlying meaning. However, the And has many choices, namely,
// which one of it's subiterators will be the branch that does the Next()ing,
// and which ordering of the remaining iterators is the most efficient. In
// short, this is where a lot of the query optimization happens, and there are
// many wins to be had here, as well as many bad bugs. The worst class of bug
// changes the meaning of the query. The second worst class makes things really
// slow.
//
// The good news is this: If Optimize() is never called (turned off, perhaps) we can
// be sure the results are as good as the query language called for.
//
// In short, tread lightly.
